 This program is a simple demonstration of an evolutionary algorithm. 
 
 You have just discovered a hidden cave filled with an enormous cache
 of gems and jewels. Each gem has a value, a weight, and a volume. You only have
 one opportunity to fill it up with any assortment of gems, and you've brought
